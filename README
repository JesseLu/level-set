A simple 2D level-set method based on Osher and Fedkiw, Level Set Methods and Dynamic Implicit Surfaces (Springer 2003).

* Build a boundary out of circles and boxes.
* Initialize/reinitialize boundary to form an approximate signed distance function.
* Advect the boundary with respect to an external velocity field.
* Move boundary with respect to boundary curvature.
